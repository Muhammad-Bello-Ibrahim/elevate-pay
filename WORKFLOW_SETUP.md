# ðŸŽ‰ GitHub Actions Android Release Workflow - Setup Complete!

## âœ… Implementation Summary

Your GitHub Actions workflow has been successfully implemented with all requested features:

### ðŸ“‹ Requirements Met:
1. **âœ… Triggers on push to main branch** - Configured in workflow trigger
2. **âœ… Automatic version tag generation** - Uses `v1.0.YYYYMMDDHHMMSS` format  
3. **âœ… Android APK build** - Integrated with Expo EAS Build service
4. **âœ… GitHub Release creation** - Automated with proper metadata
5. **âœ… APK attachment** - APK files attached to each release
6. **âœ… Saved as .github/workflows/release.yml** - Correct file location

## ðŸš€ Next Steps to Activate

### 1. Required: Add Expo Token (For Production Builds)
```bash
# Go to your GitHub repository
# Navigate to: Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions  
# Add new repository secret:
Name: EXPO_TOKEN
Value: [Your Expo access token from expo.dev]
```

### 2. Optional: Customize EAS Build
The workflow auto-generates a basic `eas.json` if none exists. You can customize it:
```json
{
  "build": {
    "production": {
      "android": {
        "buildType": "apk"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Test the Workflow
```bash
# Make any change and push to main
git add .
git commit -m "Test release workflow"
git push origin main

# The workflow will automatically:
# 1. Generate a version tag like: v1.0.20240118123045
# 2. Build APK with EAS Build
# 3. Create GitHub release
# 4. Attach APK for download
```

## ðŸ“± What Happens Next

When you push to main branch:

1. **Version Generation**: Creates unique timestamp-based tags
2. **APK Build**: Uses Expo EAS Build (or mock APK for testing)
3. **Release Creation**: Publishes to GitHub Releases with:
   - Release notes
   - Build information  
   - Downloadable APK file

## ðŸ”§ Workflow Features

- **Smart Tagging**: Won't create duplicate tags if version already exists
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when EXPO_TOKEN not configured
- **Documentation**: Complete setup guide in `.github/workflows/README.md`
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of build artifacts
- **Validation**: Verifies release creation

## ðŸ“– Documentation

See `.github/workflows/README.md` for complete setup instructions, troubleshooting, and customization options.
