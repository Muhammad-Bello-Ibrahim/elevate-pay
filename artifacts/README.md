# Artifacts Directory

This directory contains APK files generated by the CI/CD pipeline.

APK files are automatically generated and committed by GitHub Actions when:
1. A new tag matching `v*.*.*` is pushed
2. A manual build is triggered via the GitHub Actions UI

## File Naming Convention
- `ElevateX-{TAG}.apk` - APK built for the specified tag

## Note
These files are committed to the repository by the CI/CD process to provide easy access to built APKs for each release.
